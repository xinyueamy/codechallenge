Code challenge - quiz app

##Problem 
Write a web app to allow users to do multiple question quiz. Display result at the end.

##Solution
I used Javascript with CSS and html to complete the task. It allows users to do quiz. The web appication tracks how many questions are left and how many questions are attempted. And when the user finishes all questions, it will display score at the end indicating how many correct answers the user has obtained.

Current solution focuses on front-end only. It is not connected to a db yet. I was thinking of doing the backend with ruby or Nodejs at very first but I will have my final exams early in May so I didn't get much time to do this challenge. So as an alternative way, I wrote in questions inside my js code as an array. 

It will be good if I had connected the web application to a db to make it functionally working. If I could have more time, I will definitely try to apply Nodejs to link the app to db and make it run on server.
